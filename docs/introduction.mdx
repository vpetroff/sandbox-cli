## Why Sandbox CLI?

Traditional deployment to development environments often involves complex setup, multiple tools, and time-consuming configuration. Sandbox CLI eliminates this friction by providing:

- **Unified Interface**: One CLI for multiple cloud providers
- **Instant Deployment**: From code to running application in minutes
- **Development Focus**: Built specifically for development and testing workflows
- **Provider Flexibility**: Switch between providers without changing your workflow
- **Command Execution**: Debug and manage applications directly from your terminal
