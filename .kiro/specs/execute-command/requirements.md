# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds the ability to execute commands directly in deployed sandbox environments. Users can run shell commands, scripts, or other executables within their current sandbox without needing to access the sandbox directly through other means.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to execute commands in my current sandbox, so that I can run scripts, check logs, or perform maintenance tasks without leaving my local development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `execute <command>` THEN the system SHALL execute the command in the currently selected sandbox
2. WHEN the command executes THEN the system SHALL stream the output back to my terminal in real-time
3. WHEN the command completes THEN the system SHALL return the exit code
4. IF no current sandbox is selected THEN the system SHALL return an error message prompting to select one
5. WHEN the command fails THEN the system SHALL display the error output and exit code

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to execute commands with arguments and options, so that I can run complex commands and scripts in my sandbox.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `execute "npm install"` THEN the system SHALL execute the npm install command with proper argument parsing
2. WHEN I run `execute "ls -la /workspaces"` THEN the system SHALL execute the command with all flags and arguments
3. WHEN I run commands with quotes THEN the system SHALL preserve the command structure
4. WHEN I run multi-word commands THEN the system SHALL handle them correctly
5. WHEN I run commands with special characters THEN the system SHALL escape them properly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to execute commands in a specific working directory, so that I can run commands in the context of my project files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `execute` THEN the system SHALL execute commands in the default project directory (/workspaces/project)
2. WHEN I run `execute --cwd /path` THEN the system SHALL execute the command in the specified directory
3. WHEN the specified directory doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL return an error
4. WHEN no cwd is specified THEN the system SHALL use the project root as default
5. WHEN relative paths are used THEN the system SHALL resolve them relative to the project root

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see command execution progress and status, so that I understand what's happening during long-running commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I execute a command THEN the system SHALL show which sandbox the command is running in
2. WHEN a command is executing THEN the system SHALL show a progress indicator
3. WHEN output is available THEN the system SHALL stream it in real-time
4. WHEN the command completes THEN the system SHALL show the final status and exit code
5. WHEN I interrupt the command THEN the system SHALL handle the interruption gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the execute command to work with different sandbox providers, so that I can use it regardless of my deployment target.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Daytona sandboxes THEN the execute command SHALL work correctly
2. WHEN using Azure Container Instances THEN the execute command SHALL work correctly
3. WHEN the provider doesn't support command execution THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message
4. WHEN the sandbox is not running THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error
5. WHEN provider-specific errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide helpful troubleshooting information
